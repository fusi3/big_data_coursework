# big_data_coursework

Worked on creating a storage bucket in Google Cloud Platform and then creating different variations of clusters (master nodes, worker nodes and storage) to read and write data from our script to the cloud. Spark and Tensorflow libraries were used and understanding their interplay was a key discovery. Additionally worked on understanding the importance of caching and where in the process would it provide the most speed.
